# steps-to-publish-to-github
today's a good day to reinvent the wheel - they are just not round enough
I know github integrates with the likes of PHPStorm and Visual Studio but I just find the gitbash easier to work with for now. 
At some point ill use the integrated bits but for now this wheel turns just fine!

Found today that its the same method to publish to network/remote repository - just replace the URL with a Network Path. I think for now, I will map the UNC to a drive to keep things simple.
